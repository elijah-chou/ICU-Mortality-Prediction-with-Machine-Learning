# ICU-Mortality-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

This repository contains all of the Python scripts used to analyze the performance of various machine learning models using data taken from the MIMIC-IV dataset as part of a final project for the CS 334 Machine Learning class taught at Emory University by Dr. Li Xiong. Tiantian Li, Tianqi Bao, and Elijah Chou were the team members that curated and debugged this repository of code. 

In this project, our group worked through the whole process of data cleaning, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation to build a stronger foundation of the machine learning material that we went over in class.
